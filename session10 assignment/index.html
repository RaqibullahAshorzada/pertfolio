                   <h3>Practical</h3>
                    <p>
                        The key factor to learn programming is <br>
                        The practical coding, how much you code <br>
                        The more you code the mor you learn;<br>
                        In the process of writing code you face <br>
                        problems and solving those problem helps <br>
                        you a lot to learn more and search for it <br>
                        that is why when I learn something I get <br>
                        into coding more than studying the theory; <br>
